# gstreamer1.0-plugin-multibox-dvbmediasink
This git is based on pli4 git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpli/gst-plugin-dvbmediasink Branch gst-1.0
It adds support for more boxes then only the et stb's.
Boxes which currently should be ok are:
vuplus series, dm8000 and dm800se
alias : christophecvr
stefansat@telenet.be

An example off bb file is added.

This is the one I use in openpli with the modern openembedded-oe-core.

How to use :

This fork of the dvbmediasink was amended for use with Azbox machines only!
It is based on git://github.com/christophecvr/gstreamer1.0-plugin-multibox-dvbmediasink
 
For Azbox machines add --with-azbox.
Some Images supporting AzboxHD machines add --with-azboxhd. (E.g. in HDMU image)

Examples configs :

Default for all Azbox : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-wma --with-wmv --with-pcm --with-dtsdownmix --with-azbox"
AzboxHD for some Images  : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-wma --with-wmv --with-pcm --with-dtsdownmix --with-azboxhd"
